# rusty-afOS
A rust OS

- Creating a rust binary that runs on bare metal without any underlying OS.
  (well bare bones already means that)
  
- 2022_10_28 : Built the OS!!, When booted it just prints TEXT on the screen .... is that even an OS??
                I mean ... i am using a program to run directly on the the cpu and make it output stuff ... 
                so that is technically an "Operating System" ig
